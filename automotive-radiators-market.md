<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Down-Flow</li><li>Cross-Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive radiators are heat exchange devices used in vehicles to control the engine temperature. Down-flow radiators have coolant flowing from the top of the radiator to the bottom, while cross-flow radiators have coolant flowing horizontally from one side to the other. The difference lies in the direction of coolant flow and the design of the radiator tanks. Down-flow radiators are commonly used in older vehicles, while cross-flow radiators are more commonly found in modern vehicles. Both types serve the purpose of dissipating heat generated by the engine, ensuring optimal performance and longevity.</p></p>
