<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Samarium-Cobalt Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SmCo5</li><li>Sm2Co17</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo) magnet market is divided into two types, SmCo5 and Sm2Co17. SmCo5 magnets are composed of 50% samarium, 35% cobalt, and 15% copper or iron. They offer lower magnetic properties compared to Sm2Co17 magnets but are more resistant to corrosion. Sm2Co17 magnets, on the other hand, contain 2 atoms of samarium for every atom of cobalt and are much more powerful than SmCo5 magnets. However, Sm2Co17 magnets are prone to corrosion and require protective coatings.</p></p>
