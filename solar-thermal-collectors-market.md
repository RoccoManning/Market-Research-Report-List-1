<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Collectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Plate Collectors</li><li>Evacuated Tube Collectors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solar thermal collectors are devices that utilize solar energy to heat water or air. There are two main types of solar thermal collectors in the market: flat plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors. Flat plate collectors consist of a black absorber plate that absorbs sunlight and transfers the heat to a fluid passing through pipes. Evacuated tube collectors, on the other hand, consist of parallel rows of glass tubes with a heat pipe inside, allowing for better insulation and higher efficiency. Both types contribute to the utilization and harnessing of solar energy for heating purposes.</p></p>
