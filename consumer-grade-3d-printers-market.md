<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Consumer Grade 3D Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FDM Technology</li><li>SLA Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Consumer Grade 3D Printers in the market are primarily categorized into two types: FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) Technology and SLA (Stereolithography) Technology. FDM printers work by melting and extruding thermoplastic filaments, layer by layer, to create the desired 3D object. On the other hand, SLA printers use a liquid resin that is cured by a UV laser to solidify each layer. Both technologies offer high-quality prints, but FDM printers are generally more affordable and easier to use, while SLA printers excel in producing complex and intricate designs.</p></p>
