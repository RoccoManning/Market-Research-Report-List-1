<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Thermal Spray Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combustion Flame Process</li><li>Electrical Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Metal thermal spray coating is a process used to improve the performance and durability of metal surfaces. The combustion flame process involves heating a material (such as metal wire or powder) to create a molten state, which is then sprayed onto the surface. This method is commonly used for coatings with high thickness. On the other hand, the electrical process involves the use of electric arcs or plasmas to melt the coating material, which is then sprayed onto the surface. This technique is typically used for coatings requiring precise control over thickness and composition.</p></p>
