<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Pumps for Medical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Vacuum pumps play a crucial role in the medical industry, aiding various applications such as medical suction, laboratory equipment, and surgical procedures. The market for medical vacuum pumps can be categorized into two types: positive displacement and centrifugal pumps. Positive displacement pumps create a vacuum by using a mechanical mechanism to expand and contract a chamber, creating suction. Centrifugal pumps, on the other hand, use an impeller to generate suction by spinning, propelling air outward and creating a vacuum in the process. Both types of pumps are important in medical settings, each with their own advantages and applications.</p></p>
