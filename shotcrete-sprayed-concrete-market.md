<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shotcrete-sprayed Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Mix Shotcrete-sprayed Concrete</li><li>Dry Mix Shotcrete-sprayed Concrete</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Shotcrete-sprayed concrete is a construction technique where concrete is pneumatically sprayed onto surfaces using a nozzle. There are two main types of shotcrete-sprayed concrete markets: wet mix and dry mix. In the wet mix market, concrete is mixed with water before being sprayed onto the surface. This method allows for better control of the concrete mix and produces a smoother finish. On the other hand, in the dry mix market, dry ingredients are mixed with water at the nozzle, resulting in a more flexible application process and better adhesion to vertical surfaces.</p></p>
