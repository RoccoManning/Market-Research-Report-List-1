<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion System (ATS) market consists of two main types: Unwashed ATS and Washed ATS. Unwashed ATS involves the collection and reinfusion of the patientâ€™s blood without any processing or washing. This type is typically used in emergency situations or when time is limited. On the other hand, Washed ATS involves the collection of blood from the patient, followed by processing and removal of unwanted substances, such as red blood cells, before reinfusion. This type is commonly employed during surgeries where higher precision and removal of impurities are required.</p></p>
