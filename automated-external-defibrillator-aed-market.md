<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two types of Automated External Defibrillators (AED) in the market: semi-automated and fully automated. Semi-automated AEDs require the user to manually push a button to deliver an electric shock to the patient's heart. These devices analyze the heart's rhythm and prompt the user with voice and visual instructions. On the other hand, fully automated AEDs deliver the shock automatically without the need for user intervention. They also provide instructions for CPR and administer the shock if necessary. Both types are designed to assist in the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest.</p></p>
