<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Friction Clutch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Friction Clutch</li><li>Dry Friction Clutch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive friction clutch market consists of two main types: wet friction clutch and dry friction clutch. Wet friction clutches use an oil bath for lubrication, which helps to dissipate heat and reduce wear, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, dry friction clutches rely on friction between two solid surfaces without any lubrication, making them more efficient but with a higher tendency for wear. Both types play a crucial role in transmitting torque from the engine to the drivetrain, enabling smooth engagement and disengagement of the powertrain.</p></p>
