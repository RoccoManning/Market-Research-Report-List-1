<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft G-meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Piezoresistive Type</li><li>Potentiometer Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft G-meters are devices used to measure and display the acceleration forces experienced by an aircraft. There are three main types of G-meters: piezoelectric, piezoresistive, and potentiometer. </p><p>Piezoelectric G-meters utilize piezoelectric materials that generate an electrical charge when subjected to mechanical stress. Piezoresistive G-meters use materials whose electrical resistance changes proportionally to the applied force. Potentiometer G-meters employ a voltage divider circuit, with the output voltage proportional to the acceleration force. </p><p>These different types of G-meters offer varying levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability in measuring G-forces in aircraft.</p></p>
