<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravitational Dewatering Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Gravity Dehydration</li><li>Gravity Concentration Dehydration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gravitational dewatering equipment refers to machines used to remove water from solid materials. There are two main types of gravitational dewatering equipment: natural gravity dehydration and gravity concentration dehydration. Natural gravity dehydration utilizes the force of gravity to separate water from solids, typically by allowing the mixture to settle and the water to drain out. Gravity concentration dehydration involves using centrifugal force to separate water from solids, often by spinning the mixture rapidly to force the water outwards while retaining the solids in the center.</p></p>
