<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zirconia Ceramic Block for Denture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Block</li><li>Disc</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The zirconia ceramic block for denture market is divided into two types: blocks and discs. Blocks are blocks of zirconia ceramic used as the primary material for creating dentures. They are usually larger in size and require cutting and milling processes to shape them into the desired form. On the other hand, discs are smaller in size and are already pre-milled. Dentists can directly use these discs to fabricate dentures, saving time and effort. Both block and disc types serve as essential components in the production of high-quality dentures.</p></p>
