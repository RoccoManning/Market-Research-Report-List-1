<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Prefilters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid or Screen</li><li>Spongy Looking</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air pre-filters are essential components of air filtration systems that capture larger particles like dust, pollen, and pet hair before they reach the main filter. There are two common types of air pre-filters: grid or screen filters, and spongy looking filters. Grid or screen filters consist of a mesh-like material that traps larger particles as air flows through. On the other hand, spongy looking filters have a porous texture and can efficiently capture particles while maintaining a high airflow. These pre-filters are used across various industries and applications to improve air quality and prolong the lifespan of main filters.</p></p>
