<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drains Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Surgical drains systems are used to remove excess fluid or air from a surgical site. Passive drains rely on gravity or pressure differentials to drain fluids, while active drains use negative pressure to actively suction fluids. Passive drains are simple, low-cost, and suitable for most cases, whereas active drains are more complex, expensive, and are typically used for situations with high-volume drainage requirements or when continuous suction is needed. Both types play crucial roles in promoting post-operative healing and reducing complications.</p></p>
