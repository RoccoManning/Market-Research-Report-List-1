<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Damper actuators are devices used to control the opening and closing of dampers, which regulate airflow in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Non-spring return damper actuators use an electric motor to control the damper position and are commonly used in applications where the damper needs to remain in the same position during power outages. Spring return damper actuators use a spring to return the damper to a specified position when power is lost. They are often used in applications that require fail-safe operation.</p></p>
