<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stimulation Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proppants</li><li>Chemicals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stimulation materials market consists of two major types: proppants and chemicals. Proppants are small particles, such as sand or ceramics, that are used to hold open the fractures created in underground rock formations during hydraulic fracturing. They enhance the flow of oil or gas to the wellbore. Chemicals, on the other hand, include various additives and treatments that are used to improve the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing by reducing friction, preventing bacterial growth, or altering fluid viscosity. Both proppants and chemicals play crucial roles in enhancing the production of oil and gas from reservoirs.</p></p>
