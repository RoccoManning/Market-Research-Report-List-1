<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aortic Valve Replacement Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aortic valve replacement devices are used to treat aortic valve diseases by replacing the faulty valve. There are two main types of procedures for implanting these devices: open surgery and minimally invasive surgery. Open surgery involves a large incision in the chest, allowing direct access to the heart. Minimally invasive surgery, on the other hand, uses small incisions and specialized instruments to access and replace the valve. Both methods aim to improve the functionality of the heart and enhance the patient's quality of life.</p></p>
