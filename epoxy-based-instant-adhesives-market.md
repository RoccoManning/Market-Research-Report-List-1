<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy-based Instant Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Cure Adhesive</li><li>Heat Cure Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Epoxy-based instant adhesives come in two main types: cold cure adhesive and heat cure adhesive. Cold cure adhesive is designed to bond materials at room temperature without the need for additional heat applications. It provides fast bonding and is ideal for quick repairs or small-scale applications. Heat cure adhesive, on the other hand, requires heat to initiate the curing process, usually by exposing the adhesive to high temperatures. This type offers a longer open assembly time and is commonly used for larger projects or when a longer curing time is needed.</p></p>
