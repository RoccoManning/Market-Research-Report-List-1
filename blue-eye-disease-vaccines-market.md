<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blue Eye Disease Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blue Eye Disease is a viral infection that affects livestock, particularly sheep and cattle, causing significant economic losses. Two types of vaccines are used to control this disease: live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines contain weakened or attenuated forms of the virus, which stimulate a mild immune response in the animals. In contrast, killed vaccines consist of inactivated virus particles that are incapable of causing infection but still trigger an immune response. Both vaccine types aim to protect animals from Blue Eye Disease and reduce its spread within livestock populations.</p></p>
