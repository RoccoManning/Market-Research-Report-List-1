<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Pressure Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Monitors</li><li>Non-Contact Monitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraocular pressure monitors are devices used to measure the pressure inside the eye. There are two main types of intraocular pressure monitors: contact monitors and non-contact monitors. Contact monitors involve direct contact with the surface of the eye using a device such as a tonometer. This type of monitor requires the patient to apply an anesthetic drop and then the device is gently placed on the eye. Non-contact monitors, on the other hand, measure the eye pressure without physical contact. These monitors use a puff of air to measure the resistance of the eye, providing a painless and convenient option for patients.</p></p>
