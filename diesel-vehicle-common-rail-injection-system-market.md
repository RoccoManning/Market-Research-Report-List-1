<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Vehicle Common Rail Injection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low pressure pump system</li><li>High pressure pump system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diesel vehicle common rail injection system market can be categorized into two types: the low pressure pump system market and the high pressure pump system market. In the low pressure pump system market, the fuel is supplied at a lower pressure level to the common rail. This fuel is then pressurized to a higher level by the high pressure pump system before being injected into the engine's combustion chamber. The high pressure pump system market involves the use of a higher pressure pump to deliver fuel directly to the common rail, without relying on a low pressure pump.</p></p>
