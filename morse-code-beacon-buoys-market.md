<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Morse code Beacon Buoys Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal</li><li>Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Morse code beacon buoys market consists of two main types: metal and plastic. Metal buoys are made of durable materials such as steel or aluminum, providing robustness and resistance against harsh weather conditions. They are commonly used in deep-sea environments due to their strength and stability. On the other hand, plastic buoys are lightweight and more cost-effective than their metal counterparts. They are preferred for shallower waters and less extreme weather conditions. Both types serve as navigational aids, guiding ships and boats by emitting Morse code signals to communicate important information.</p></p>
