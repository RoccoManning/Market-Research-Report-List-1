<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-Based Ethylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sugars</li><li>Starch</li><li>Lignocellulosic Biomass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bio-based ethylene market can be categorized into three types: sugars, starch, and lignocellulosic biomass. Sugars are derived from various sources like corn, sugarcane, and beets through the process of fermentation. Starch, on the other hand, is obtained from crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes, and is converted into bio-based ethylene by hydrolysis. Lignocellulosic biomass includes non-edible plant materials such as wood, grass, and agricultural waste, which undergo a complex process called thermochemical conversion to produce bio-based ethylene. These different types contribute to the overall bio-based ethylene market.</p></p>
