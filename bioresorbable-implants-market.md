<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metals</li><li>Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioresorbable implants are medical devices that are designed to be gradually dissolved by the body over time. There are two main types of materials used for bioresorbable implants: metals and polymers. Metal-based implants are typically made from materials such as magnesium or iron, which can safely degrade in the body without causing harm. On the other hand, polymer-based implants are made from biocompatible plastics that are gradually broken down and absorbed by the body. Both types of implants offer advantages such as reduced risk of infection and reduced need for further surgeries.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Implants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stents</li><li>Orthopedics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioresorbable implants market is primarily focused on two major applications: stents and orthopedics. In the stents application, bioresorbable implants are used to restore blood flow in blocked arteries and prevent further complications. These implants gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the need for additional surgical procedures. In the orthopedics market, bioresorbable implants are used for bone fixation and regeneration. These implants provide temporary support and eventually dissolve, allowing for natural bone healing and minimizing the risk of implant-related complications. Overall, bioresorbable implants offer significant advantages in these applications by promoting healing and reducing long-term treatment costs.</p></p>
